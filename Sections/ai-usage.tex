\section*{AI Usage Declaration}
AI was for the most part not used in the project part of the thesis, save for one instance. During a period of very slow progression, there was an attempt to coerce chatGPT into making sense of the build errors given by \taffo{} when trying to build it using Clang version 15 built from source in debug mode. This led to many answers, though unfortunately no good ones. This only served to reinforce my opinion that relying on large language models for anything is a net waste of time, even without considering the blatant theft of intellectual property that it represents. Generative AI has not been used in the writing of this thesis.
