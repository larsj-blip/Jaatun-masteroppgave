Approximate computing is a computing paradigm that achieves more performant and/or more power efficient code through approximation. Both computationally heavy and computationally lightweight applications, especially those based on low-powered IoT hardware, may stand to benefit from these improvements. If done in software, this presents an economic and environmental motivation for applying approximate computing to preexisting projects. 

One of the things blocking the adoption of approximate computing in industry is the lack of dependability analyses of the reliability of approximate computing strategies in software. This thesis aims to show the direction that these dependability analyses should take.
