\section{Further Work}

The next campaign would be performed on non-benchmark code. The chosen library was OpenCV which is used for computer vision applications in python and c++, more specifically a facial recognition example written using the OpenCV library. The fault injection planned here would also be single bit fault injections in variables, however as the output from these functions are not numbers but a graphical representation of where a face in an image is, the error would be measured in how many frames, if at all, a face is detected in a standard video representation.

To collect data on developmental faults, i.e., faults that do not occur when the code is running but occur during the development of the code, another campaign was planned. This fault injection campaign was inspired by the technique and paper on G-SWFIT.
